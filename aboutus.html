        B Locker is a Blockchain enabled locker, which allows its users to securely store their data in a decentralized environment. <br><br>
        B Locker is developed as a safe for users who question data theft from storing data in centralized domains. Data such as media items (images, videos) ,
        documents types, and even passwords can all be stored into B locker and accessible at user’s convenience.<br><br>
        In an interesting perspective, B Locker can also be read as ‘Blocker’ which implies that this locker doesnt involve any centralized medium and increases security.
